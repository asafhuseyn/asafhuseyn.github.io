As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer, I bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the table. My programming journey started with foundational languages such as Turbo Pascal, Perl, and VB, and has evolved over the years to include advanced proficiency in C, C++ (with frameworks like wxWidgets, GTK, and Qt), C# (including WinForms, WPF, MAUI, ASP.NET, Blazor, and EF), and now Swift.

Throughout my career, I have developed a robust skill set in database management and server configuration, designing and deploying complex databases using PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle DB, and SQLite. I am adept at managing various web and application servers, including IIS, Apache, Nginx, WildFly, TomCat, and GlassFish, across operating systems such as Oracle Linux, Debian, RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu Server, and Windows Server. My experience extends to cloud services, particularly Azure and AWS, where I configure and manage server environments.

I possess extensive knowledge in architectural and design patterns, ranging from structural patterns like N-tier and Clean Architecture to presentation layer architectures such as MVC, MVVM, MVVM-C, and the innovative MV approach for SwiftUI. My technical expertise is further complemented by over a decade of Linux usage, covering distributions from Arch Linux to Kali Linux, and extending to Unix-based systems like FreeBSD.

Currently, my focus is on developing applications for the Apple ecosystem using Swift, along with SwiftUI, SwiftData, Vapor, and other Swift-related technologies. This shift represents not only a continuation of my past successes but also a commitment to continuous innovation and advancement in the rapidly evolving field of software engineering
